src/  	   	  all source code
src/*.ml       	  all OCaml source code for IO
src/coq/*.v    	  main programs written with Coq
src/ai		  extracted ai programs

Currently, there is no proof at all.  Certification of interpretter is easy task if
any operational semantics is given.

AI is written in combinatoric way.  Using two monads "cmdex" and "aicmd", we can easily
construct AIs.

TODO
* certify interpretter.
* separate side effect of aicmd for test run.
* hide operations of "ptr" type in monad properly.
* separate monad interface in other library to construct a more generic
  programming enviromnent.
